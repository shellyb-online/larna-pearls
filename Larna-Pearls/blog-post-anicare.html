        <h2>AniCARE 360: Keeping Livestock Healthy Naturally</h2>
        <p><strong>AniCARE 360 is GreenHeart SE's innovative solution for natural animal care.</strong> This feed enhancer harnesses the power of biochar and natural minerals to detoxify livestock digestive systems, improve performance, and reduce environmental impact.</p>
        <h3>Healthier Animals, Healthier Planet</h3>
        <p>By adding AniCARE 360 to animal feed, farmers help their livestock absorb nutrients more efficiently and reduce harmful emissions. The biochar binds toxins and supports gut health, leading to stronger, healthier animals and cleaner farms.</p>
